## Project1:
### Project on COVID-19:
1) How is the number of deaths from COVID-19 in the U.S. evolving through time?
  - Visualisation and interactive map of the U.S. with the number of deaths from COVID-19 by states and by time (Zineb) (1)
2) What are the main risk factors of deaths from COVID-19? What are the most dangerous conditions?
  - Interactive bar plots with different conditions from different risk factors, and several plots in regards to this subject (Fahim) (1)
3) How did the mortality rate evolve through time? 
  - Plots on the mortality rate through time, and with respect to different risk factors (Salima) (2) (4) (5)
4) Does the geolocation of the state have an impact on the number of cases and the number of deaths from COVID-19?
  - Interactive plot on the comparison of the numbers betweens two States (Seorim) (2) (3) 
  - Separation analysis: correlation across different degrees of separation. (Mathias) (2) (3)

## Report outline:
-A clear statement of the goal of the mini-project (in short sentence(s) and most preferably in the form of (a) question(s) you intend to answer).
-A brief summary of the approach you have followed to achieve your goal. 
-A brief introduction to the problem (what has been done before in this context, why is the problem you are tackling relevant, etc...).
-Comprehensive descriptive analysis of the data (which variables you have available, are they continuous, discrete?, etc...).
-Comprehensive presentation of results (which statistical models/techniques have you used -if any- and why they were adequate to tackle your problem with the data you had).
-Conclusions and discussion.
-Possible future work.
