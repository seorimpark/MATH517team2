### Approaches:
To answer the above questions, we will proceed as follows:
A descriptive and visual approach where we will produce interactive plots with information on number of deaths along different dimensions: geographically, temporally, by different risk factors. We will then proceed with the analysis of mortality rate as a function of time and based on different risk factors. Afterwards we switch to the correlation and spatial comparison studies: between two selected states, two neighbouring states or considering different levels of neighbourhoods through a separation analysis.

## Sources of information/ datasets:

In this project, several datasets were used to answer our questions. Each one of them refers to the same population (the US). Here are more specific descriptions. 

### US deaths within categories and states

The first dataset we use is about [provisional COVID--19 deaths by place of death and age](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Deaths-by-Place-of-Death-and-/4va6-ph5s) from the CDC in the US. A complete description of it is available on the web page. 

The variables we used in this project are : `Group`, `Year`, `Month`,	`HHS Region`,	`State`,	`Place of Death`, `Age group`, `COVID-19 Deaths` and `Total Deaths`. What is particular here is that the sum of `COVID-19 Deaths` is not the total number of deaths in the US. Actually, we need to filter our data by `Group`, `State`, `Place of Death` and `Age Group` in order to get what we want.

A last thing we should take into account is that those numbers of deaths are not the exact number that happened during a given period. The reason is that there is always a lag in time (usually 1 to 8 weeks) between the instant when the death occurred and between when the death certificate is completed and submitted for reporting purposes.

## Packages

Here are some packages used in our project. Make sure they are installed before running the R Markdown file. Since the format of this Markdown is not standard, you need to install the *Distill* package. Instructions can be found on [Github](https://github.com/rstudio/distill).

````{r, message=FALSE}

library(readr)
library(dplyr) # Useful for reading variables containing spaces
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape)
library(stringr) # Labels overlap
library(scales) # Labels value format
library(usmap)

## Risk factors 

In this section, we will have a closer look at the risk factors of death from COVID--19. More particularly, we will first consider age and second the place where death occured.  

````{r, include=FALSE}

data = read_csv("Data/Provisional_COVID-19_Deaths_by_Place_of_Death_and_Age.csv")

head(data)
colnames(data)

# Taking away useless variables
data = data[,-c(1,2,3,5,6,14,16,17)]
colnames(data)

# Looking at values taken by certain variables
unique(data$`Age group`)
unique(data$State)
unique(data$Group)
unique(data$`Place of Death`)

####### Comparing age and nb of deaths #######

# Filtering, deleting and ordering columns
age = filter(data, `Age group` != "All Ages" & State == "United States" 
               & Group == "By Total" & `Place of Death` == "Total - All Places of Death") 

# Verifying `HHS Region`==0 before deleting
unique(age$`HHS Region`)

# Taking only age group and covid deaths
age = subset(age, select=c(`Age group`, `COVID-19 Deaths`))

# Converting to frame
colnames(age)
dim(age)
age = data.frame(age)
age

````

### Age group

Here are deaths per age group since the beginning of the pandemic.

````{r, echo=FALSE}

# Barplot
ggplot(data=age, aes(x=Age.group, y=COVID.19.Deaths, fill=COVID.19.Deaths)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low="cyan", high="blue", name = NULL) +
  ggtitle("Covid deaths per age group") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=16, hjust = 0.5)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) + 
  labs(x = 'Age group', y = 'Deaths') +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = function(x) str_wrap(x, width = 12)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = format_format(big.mark = " ", decimal.mark = ",", 
                                            scientific = FALSE))

````

Older people are those who died the most as expected. The same barplot is available by month in an interactive web app. You can access it by clicking [here](https://fahimbeck.shinyapps.io/barplot_app/). By moving the slider, we are always able to observe a right-increase tendency on the barplots. We are also able to identify each wave. 

### Place of death

````{r, include=FALSE}

####### Comparing places and causes #######

# Filtering, deleting and ordering columns
place = filter(data, `Age group` == "All Ages" & State == "United States" 
             & Group == "By Total" & `Place of Death` != "Total - All Places of Death") 

# Verifying `HHS Region`==0 before deleting
unique(place$`HHS Region`)

# Taking only age group and covid deaths
place = subset(place, select=c(`Place of Death`, `COVID-19 Deaths`))

# Converting to frame
colnames(place)
dim(place)
place = data.frame(place)
place

````

Here are deaths per place of death since the beginning of the pandemic.

````{r, echo=FALSE}

# Barplot
ggplot(data=place, aes(x=reorder(Place.of.Death, COVID.19.Deaths), y=COVID.19.Deaths)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill='steelblue') +
  coord_flip() +
  ggtitle("Covid deaths per place of death") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=16, hjust = 0.5)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(face="bold", color="black",size=8, angle=0),
        axis.text.y = element_text(face="bold", color="black",size=8, angle=0)) + 
  labs(x = NULL, y = 'deaths') +  
  scale_x_discrete(labels = function(x) str_wrap(x, width = 25)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = format_format(big.mark = " ", decimal.mark = ",", 
                                            scientific = FALSE))

````

Here we can clearly see that most people were inpatients in a healthcare setting before dying. This includes ICUs and reflects our expectations. Then, people in nursing homes died also a lot as expected (older people being at risk), but much less than the previous category.
